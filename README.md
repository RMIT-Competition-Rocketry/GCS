    - [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa) with both COTS and SRAD hardware
- Multithreaded data ingestion server
    - Written in C++
    - Built with [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/) for IPC communication
    - IPC Data serialisation with [Google's Protocol Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/)
- Multithreaded CLI based process manager
    - Written in Python
    - Includes a device emulator for internal unit tests that attaches from the hardware layer to create a fake unix device file at `/dev/`
