# Algorithmics Relevance

Relevance to VCE algorithmics

- Uses IPC queues to collect data
    - Pendant emulator converts this to a stack (kind of)
- Sequence diagram uses a finite state machine design pattern
- This has a lot of OOP, relevant to algo modularity
- Simulation software touches on the idea of a priority queue
- Uses priority queues to trim simulation data into realistic data
- Uses Queues to order incoming STDOUT data for callback parsing
- Uses priority queues to close proccess in the order they sa
- Uses recursion to expand on sub defintions in the protobuf data logger
- Av process tests: Psuedocode, decision trees
